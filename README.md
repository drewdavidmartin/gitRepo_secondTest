## Commits
Using the online interface we can edit an existing file and commit this. Git then tracks these changes as commits and you can view the history of the your edits by looking at the history of the commits. 

## Branches
Every Repo starts with a branch, which by default is called `main`. Branches can be used for creating different ideas, tools, etc, which could potentially be merged into the main branch in the future. A branch can be created to do almost anything. If you idea works then it can be merged into the main branch.

## Pull Request
After someone has made a respository another user can fork that repository. After they fork it they can add to it, by adding functionality, code, text, etc. Once they are done and the code seems to work they can make a pull request to the original repository. The owner / delegates of the original repository can review what this other user has done on the fork'ed repository and they can accept that pull request and therefore pull the code from that other user and merge it with their repository. 

## Push Request
A push request is similar to a pull request, with the difference being that the user issuing the request has the proper permissions to accept the merge.
