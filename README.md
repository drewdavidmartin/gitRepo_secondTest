## Commits
Using the online interface we can edit an existing file and commit this. Git then tracks these changes as commits and you can view the history of the your edits by looking at the history of the commits. 

##Branches
Every Repo starts with a branch, which by default is called `main`. Branches can be used for creating different ideas, tools, etc, which could potentially be merged into the main branch in the future. A branch can be created to do almost anything. If you idea works then it can be merged into the main branch
